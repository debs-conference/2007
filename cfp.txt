CALL FOR PAPERS

Inaugural International Conference on
Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS 2007)

Toronto, Canada, June 20-22, 2007
http://debs.msrg.toronto.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In cooperation with:
            USENIX, IEEE and IEEE Computer Society, ACM SIGSOFT and ACM SIGMOD
Sponsorship from: CA Labs (Main Sponsor), HP Labs (Silver Sponsor), and MiTACS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Inaugural International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems is
following on the success of the previous five DEBS Workshops held from 2002 to
2006 in companion with major conferences sponsored by IEEE and ACM such as
ICDCS, ICSE, and SIGMOD/PODS.

Event-based systems have been established in industry and research for many
years.  They are now gaining increasing momentum as witnessed by current
efforts in areas including event-driven architectures, business process
management and modeling, Grid computing, Web services notifications, and
message-oriented middleware.  Events represent asynchronous state transitions
in the environment and event-based computing refers to the computational
support and abstractions required to adequately manage and process events.

Continuing DEBS as an independent conference aims to satisfy this growing and
interdisciplinary interest in event-based computing.  The objectives of the
DEBS Conference are to provide a forum dedicated to the dissemination of
original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting on
relevant experience relating to event-based computing previously scattered
across several communities.

The scope of the conference covers all topics relevant to event-based
computing ranging from those discussed in related disciplines (e.g.,
coordination, software engineering, peer-to-peer systems, Grid computing, and
streaming databases), over domain-specific topics of event-based computing
(e.g., workflow management systems, mobile computing, pervasive and ubiquitous
computing, sensor networks, user interfaces, component integration, Web
services, and embedded systems), to enterprise related topics (e.g.,
enterprise application integration, real time enterprises, and Web services
notifications).


================
Conference Scope
================

The topics addressed by the conference include, but are not limited to:

  Models, Architectures, and Paradigms

    * Event-driven architectures
    * Complex event processing
    * Basic interaction models
      (publish/subscribe, register/notify, hybrids etc.)
    * Event schemas and type systems
    * Languages for event correlation and patterns, streaming and continuous
      queries, and data fusion
    * Performance modeling and prediction based on analytic approaches
    * Design and programming methodologies (e.g., MDA-based approaches)
    * Event-based business process management and modeling
    * Experimental methodologies (e.g., design of simulations and experiments)
    * Models for static and dynamic environments (e.g., client mobility
      models, distribution of clients and their behavior)

  Middleware Infrastructures for Event-Based Computing

    * Federated event-based systems (e.g., scoping and transforming)
    * Middleware for actuator and sensor networks
    * Algorithms and protocols (e.g., data diffusion, content-based routing,
      subscription merging, matching, pattern detection, etc.)
    * Event dissemination based on peer-to-peer routing substrates
    * Implementations of streaming queries, transformations, or correlation
      engines
    * Fault-tolerance, reliability, availability, and recovery
    * Security issues (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, privacy, trust)
    * (Self-)Management (e.g., reconfiguration, adaptation, and organization)
    * Context and location awareness
    * Mobility and resource-constrained device support

  Applications, Experiences, and Requirements

    * Use cases and applications of event-based systems
    * Real-world application deployments using event-based middleware
    * Domain-specific deployments of event-based systems
    * Real-world data characterizing event-based applications
    * Benchmarks, performance evaluations, and testbeds
    * Seamless integration of event-based mechanisms into middleware platforms
    * Application requirements for next-generation event-based solutions
    * Relation to other architectures such as SOA
    * Enterprise application integration
    * Event-driven business process management
      (e.g., using RFID in logistics and healthcare)
    * Information logistics

=====================
Submission Guidelines
=====================

All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently
under review.  Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent
referees.  Papers will be evaluated according to their significance,
originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the
conference.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to attend
the conference.

Three types of paper submissions will be accepted: research papers, industry
papers, and demo papers.  Submitted papers should clearly indicate their type.
Accepted papers will be published by ACM.

The conference proceedings will be published as part of the ACM International
Proceedings Series and will be disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.

The conference adopts a **double blind** review process, where neither authors
nor reviewer know each others' identities.

Papers must not exceed the given number of pages for the respective paper type
(see below).  The required format for the submission is the ACM SIG
Proceedings Style.  The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in
the body of the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person.  This
is to facilitate a double-blind review process.  Please apply the ACM
Computing Classification categories and terms.  The ACM Computing
Classification scheme can be found at http://www.acm.org/class/1998/.  The
author kit containing the Latex templates for the required style can be found
at: http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.  More detailed
submission instructions will be posted at the conference web site.

Research Papers: (max. 12 pages)
  A research paper describes new results that advance the state-of-the-art in
  basic or applied research.  Short papers (max. 6 pages) presenting
  work-in-progress are also welcome.

Industry Papers: (max. 8 pages) 
  An industry paper describes the design, the experience (in building,
  deploying and running), or the performance of an industry system.  Commonly,
  the majority of authors on the paper are from industry.  Product marketing
  will not be accepted as paper.

Demo Papers: (max. 4 pages)
  A demo paper reports on an existing research prototype by clearly
  identifying the original contributions and ideas demonstrated.  The authors
  are expected to prepare a poster and perform a live software demonstration
  on their own laptop during an exhibit-style conference reception.  Any
  special requirements should be identified in the appendix of the paper.
