======
Scope
======

The Inaugural International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems is
following on the success of the previous five DEBS Workshops held from 2002 to
2006 in companion with major conferences sponsored by IEEE and ACM such as
ICDCS, ICSE, and SIGMOD/PODS.

Event-based systems have been established in industry and research for many
years.  They are now gaining increasing momentum as witnessed by current
efforts in areas including event-driven architectures, business process
management and modeling, Grid computing, Web services notifications, and
message-oriented middleware.  Events represent asynchronous state transitions
in the environment and event-based computing refers to the computational
support and abstractions required to adequately manage and process events.


=======================
Call for Demonstrations
=======================

The conference will feature a *demo session*, in which researchers have the
opportunity to demonstrate the real, working event-based systems they have
built.  We invite demonstrations of event-based applications, frameworks, and
algorithms that use the event-based paradigm in a new and innovative way.  The
conference brings together research and industry in distributed event-based
systems.  We explicitly encourage contributions from adjacent research
communities and application fields that may use event-based approaches. 

The demonstration session is a new and exciting way to showcase your
applications and introduce new prototypes to the community.  The demo session
will take place as an exhibit-style conference reception. 

Each demo will be represented by up to 4 pages in the proceedings.  The paper
reports on the presented research prototype and clearly identifies the
original contributions and ideas demonstrated.  In addition to the paper, the
authors are expected to prepare a poster and to perform a live software 
demonstration on their own laptop.
Any special requirements should be identified in the appendix of the paper.

Paper Submission:           March 14, 2007
Author Notification:        May 7, 2007
Final Manuscript due:       May 28, 2007
DEBS Conference:            June 20-22, 2007


=====================
Submission Guidelines
=====================

All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently
under review.  Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent
referees.  Papers will be evaluated according to their significance,
originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the
conference.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to attend
the conference.

Besides demonstration papers, the conference will also accept research papers
and industry papers.  Submitted papers should clearly indicate their type.
The conference proceedings will be published as part of the ACM International
Proceedings Series and will be disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.

The conference adopts a **double blind** review process, where neither authors
nor reviewer know each others' identities.

Demonstration papers must not exceed four pages.  The required format for the
submission is the ACM SIG Proceedings Style.  The author(s) name(s) and
address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference
should be in the third person.  This is to facilitate a double-blind review
process.  Please apply the ACM Computing Classification categories and terms.
The ACM Computing Classification scheme can be found at
http://www.acm.org/class/1998/.  The author kit containing the Latex templates
for the required style can be found at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.  More detailed submission
instructions will be posted at the conference web site.
