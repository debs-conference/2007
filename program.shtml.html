  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Grand Challenges in Distributed Event-Based Systems<br/><em>or</em><br/>Can DEBS take over the world?</h3>
 
  <p style="margin-top:5px;text-align:center;">
  <em>The panel discussion will be chaired by Joe Sventek.</em><br/>
  <em>Panel participants: Jean Bacon, Alejandro Buchmann, Gregor Hohpe, Daby Sow.</em>
  </p>

<p>
Event-based systems have been long established in industry and research.
Several current movements in distributed systems engineering are
embracing this approach, including event-driven architectures, business
process management and modeling, Grid computing, Web services
notifications and message-oriented middleware.  This adoption is
testimony to the applicability of event-based systems to a large class
of distributed applications.
</p>

<p>
The computing industry never stands still.  New, emerging, application
domains possess significantly different requirements from those that led
to the development of current event-based systems.  Some of these
domains require ingenious application of existing event-based
techniques, while others demand that we reinvent event-based techniques
to address novel requirements.
</p>

<p>
Each member of the panel will discuss the requirements posed by his/her
favourite new application domain, and the resulting challenges faced by
the DEBS research community to meet those requirements.  Our goal is
that at least one of these &quot;grand challenges&quot; will stimulate your
future research.

  <h3><a name="bass">Mythbusters: Event Stream Processing Versus Complex Event Processing</a> (<a href="bass.pdf">Slides</a>)</h3>

  </p>

<p>
There has been significant event processing controversy in the use of the
terms event stream processing (ESP) and complex event processing (CEP).
CEP was originally envisioned as a technology to extract new information
from message-based systems; while ESP was designed to extract new
information from database-oriented systems.  One school of thought is that
ESP is analogous to signal processing and CEP is more aligned with higher
level situational inferencing.  Another school of thought is that CEP and
ESP are one in the same!
</p>
<p>
This talk explores the relationship between CEP and ESP in the context of
event processing, and in particular to an event processing reference
architecture derived from earlier distributed blackboard computing models.
After introducing the model, we explore where ESP and CEP &quot;fit&quot; by
applying ESP and CEP concepts to practical use cases for event processing,
drawing from signal processing, decision theory, control theory, and
stochastic processing.  The basis of the talk is derived from established
thinking in the domain of multi-sensor data fusion, applying traditional
concepts to today's commercial view of event processing.  The talk will be
controversial and provocative, stimulating discussion and thought on areas
for further research and development.

  <p>
  Many factors are considered in the design of event-based systems. These
  parameters include the rates at which messages are generated by sensors; the
  network topology by which information about events is communicated; whether
  information is propagated continuously by analog signals, periodic synchronous
  messages, asynchronous messages or mobile agents; the computation carried out
  at different points in the network; and accuracy of sensors, actuators and
  computational nodes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  This talk proposes a mathematical model that aids
  systematic design by providing a theoretical framework for evaluating design
  alternatives. A focus of the model is the value of information: What is the
  difference in value to the overall system if a message is sent or not sent to
  an agent? What is the difference in value if a message is sent in a timely
  manner or late; if it is accurate or noisy? What should an agent do in the
  absence of information in a time interval? The ideas draw upon theory from
  control systems, signal processing, Bayesian decision theory and stochastic
  processes. The talk proposes a model and discusses its strengths and
  weaknesses. The talk develops theory, based on the model, and uses the theory
  to evaluate different implementations of event-based systems.

Event-based systems offer many benefits. They enable loose coupled,
composable solutions that can be highly scalable. They also resemble the
real world - major parts of our daily lives are governed by events: the
phone rings, a customer places an order, the fuel warning lamp in the car
comes on. Unfortunately, the architectural benefits are often offset by the
complexity of developing event-based solutions. This talk examines why
building event-based solutions can be challenging and how we can make it
more approachable.

  <h3><a name="opher">Semantic Approach to Event Processing</a> (<a href="etzion.pdf">Slides</a>)</h3>

<p>
Various approaches have been taken towards modelling and definition of event
processing systems, the dominant ones being: using rules, using SQL extensions,
and using scripts.   Yet, there are some semantic structures that are expressed
by all of them, providing the opportunity to raise the level of abstraction and
create semantic model of event processing.  This talk will describe the major
different types of event processing from the point of view of the role it plays
in computing, describe some common design patterns, and then describe the idea
of the semantic approach to event processing, the semantic abstractions that
are required in order to achieve it, and its possible automatic mappings to
various implementations.   The concepts will be demonstrated by a comprehensive
example.

<p>
Publish/subscribe is a popular event dissemination mechanism, providing
anonymous, store-and-forward message distribution.  Such systems have been
deployed in quite small application environments, such as body area networks
for patient health monitoring; they have also been deployed in extremely large
distributed application environments, such as stock price distribution systems.
</p>
<p>
The AMUSE project in the UK is a collaboration between computing researchers at
the University of Glasgow and Imperial College London.  This project is focused
on the concept of self-managed cells (SMC) as the basic unit of autonomous
computing, and the federation of such cells at different levels of scale.
Publish/subcribe implementations form the basis of SMCs at all levels of scale,
and the federation of these P/S implementations forms the basis of SMC-SMC
interactions.
</p>
<p>
This talk will present the P/S systems at the heart of small and large scale
SMCs, and explore their federation.  The efficacy of such federations will be
discussed, and lessons learned recounted.

<p>
Event-based approaches have been used in commercial systems management for many
years, primarily to accomplish point to point integration between products that
were not originally designed to work together.  They have been more
cost-effective than wholesale rewrites of incompatible products, but as they
have proliferated they have begun to succumb to brittleness and <em>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</em>
complexity issues.  The talk will be about the challenges we are facing in
moving to a next generation of event-based systems for management automation.
